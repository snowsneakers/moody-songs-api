               lyrics: `Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi\n He don't wanna know me\n Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm\n Says it was poison\n So I guess I'll go home\n Into the arms of the girl that I love\n The only love I haven't screwed up\n She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire\n I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance, we slow dance\n In the living room, but all that a stranger would see\n Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek\n They say, &quot;You're a little much for me\n You're a liability\n You're a little much for me&quot;\n So they pull back, make other plans\n I understand, I'm a liability\n Get you wild, make you leave\n I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone\n The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy\n 'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore\n And then they are bored of me\n I know that it's exciting running through the night, but\n Every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone\n Better on my own\n They say, &quot;You're a little much for me\n You're a liability\n You're a little much for me&quot;\n So they pull back, make other plans\n I understand, I'm a liability\n Get you wild, make you leave\n I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone\n They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun\n You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun`,
